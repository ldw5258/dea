The easiest way to use it is to load it from your .emacs:

: (require 'google-maps)

You can then use M-x google-maps and type a location.

Various key bindings are available. Here's a few:

  * + or - to zoom in or out;
  * left, right, up, down to move;
  * z to set a zoom level via prefix;
  * q to quit;
  * m to add or remove markers;
  * c to center the map on a place;
  * C to remove centering;
  * t to change the maptype;
  * w to copy the URL of the map to the kill-ring;
  * h to show your home.

You can integrate directly Google Maps into Org-mode:

: (require 'org-location-google-maps)

Then you can use C-c M-L to enter a location assisted by Google geocoding service. Pressing C-c M-l will show you a map.

If you want to use advanced feature, you should take a look at google-maps-static-show and google-maps-geocode-request functions.
